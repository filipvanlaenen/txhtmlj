# Typed Extensible HyperText Markup Language (XHTML) in Java (TXHTMLJ)

This project aims to provide a domain-specific language (DSL) to create XHTML
(Extensible HyperText Markup Language) files in Java in an easy way, with all
the advantages of typing. Below is a short list of the features it intends to
implement:

* Make it almost as easy to read and write XHTML producing code in Java as it is
  to read and write an XHTML file in a text editor
* Use the advantages of typing, such that the Java compiler can validate much
  of the XHTML code
  * This brings also the advantages of code-completion on XHTML producing code
* Coverage of the basic elements and concepts of XHTML
  * It is not expected to it will be possible to cover all aspects of all
    elements and concepts of XHTML
